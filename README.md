# Distributed-Information-system-prototype
This repository contain the codes from my bachelor's project. In this project me and my team mates established a communication between different SQL Servers. We developed a Java Based application. To know more functionality and technologies used please refer the report pdf.

Since crime is making the situation worse in our country day by day and there isn't enough data about all the criminals at all the police stations to put a hold on it, we have designed a new system which would help in connecting all the police stations safely and which would enable them to share the confidential data about criminals in a secure way. This system is more effective than the others in league as it takes only one detail of the accused and brings all the other available ones to the node where the query has been made. Each police station will act as a node having its own database and all of them will be connected with each other through secure protocols like TCP, and using security measures like AES, blowfish, two fish algorithms.
